## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a lot about flexbox and become very nice at it. I also learned about various other properties of CSS for styling it better.


### Continued development

I would like to focus more on flexbox to make me more comfortable with it.

### Useful resources

- W3 Schools  (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped me for understanding different properties of CSS and how they can be used.
- Code With harry (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ykmsTpIn08&list=PL64RACpaWtEVsz5CO_yFSZNwEWhVccSER&index=4) - This is an amazing video (in hindi) which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
